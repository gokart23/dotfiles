# dotfiles
A collection of config files present on my ArchLinux box. Some of the applications whose configs you can find here include:

* ViM
* xmonad
* xmobar
* xwindow
* bash
* zsh (using oh-my-zsh)

Note that: the currently configured system does NOT use a desktop environment; xmonad is the WM and xmobar/trayer/dmenu/etc. are some of the plugins providing functionality. I personally dislike display managers, so X11 startup is done manually by calling `startx` or `xinit`.

HTH :)
