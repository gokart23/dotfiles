##README - ViM

There is a lot of ViM love on the internet, and the following ones are especially noteworthy:

* [Ultimate vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) - One of the best sample vimrcs out there
* [thoughtbot vimrc](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc) - Check out their tutorials as well

There are loads of plugins as well. The plugins you can find in the `vimrc` here are:

* [MRU](https://github.com/vim-scripts/mru.vim) - Most Recently Used plugin
* [Multiple Cursors](https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors) - Sublime-style multiple cursors
* [fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) - Git-wrapper for ViM
* [Airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) - Awesome statusline plugin

You can also find lots of themes for customizing the look-and-feel of ViM. Some of the ones I've used are:

* [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/blob/master/vim-colors-solarized/colors/solarized.vim)
* [peaksea](https://github.com/vim-scripts/peaksea)

Apart from these, there are loads and loads of awesome stuff developed for ViM. So far, this config seems to be working out pretty well for me. Let me know if you find anything useful :)

Cheers!
